# Wild Whiskers Cafe
Wild Whiskers Cafe is a educational café simulator game, aimed at students and graduates – aged 18-24, and children aged 8-12. Wild Whiskers Cafe's aims are to teach these audiences about animals and cooking.  

The player runs a café with their staff member, Bunny. The café is divided into 3 sections: 
The dining room section, where customers spawn in and wait for their food 
The player’s bedroom, which they can decorate, and sleep to end the day. 
The kitchen, where all food is stored and prepared. 

Wild Whiskers Cafe will feature 20 different animals, and 15+ different meals the player can prepare for each animal. The player will only be able to prepare and serve 1 customer at a time.
